# E07a-Save-and-Load    

For MSCH-C220 at Indiana University 2020 Quick demonstration on config files. Directions are below. 

This exercise is taken from the [Basic Saving In Godot With Config Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygGaN1EOQEA) by Eric Davidson. His video will guide you through the steps required to save a value (in this case, the DisplayValue) to a config file and retrieve it when the player pushes the Save and Load buttons.

His tutorial was developed using Godot 3.1. Everything you see should be compatible with Godot 3.2, although some of the syntax highlighting might look slightly different.

After you have completed the exercise, run the program. Save a value of -3 to the config file. Update the LICENSE and README.md, and then turn in the URL to your repository on Canvas.
